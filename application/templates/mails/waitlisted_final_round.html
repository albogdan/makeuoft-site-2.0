<p>Hello {{ user.first_name }},</p>

<p>The MakeUofT team has reviewed your application, and have decided not to grant you a guaranteed spot at MakeUofT. We can only accept so many teams and participants from a large pool of applicants. These application decisions are made through comparison to other team applications - so while your application was by no means bad, other applications stood out more to the screening panel.</p>

<p>However, we have decided to place you on our day-of waitlist. At 10:00 am EST on February 15, 2020, if there is still room we will begin allowing people from the waitlist into the event on a first-come, first-serve basis. We offer <b>no guarantee</b> that you will be allowed into the event, regardless of how early you arrive. Please read our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycL-jpaXSTnz_VnXnR4OI7zTQDD3wLMQZlRmobNMMBg/edit?usp=sharing">participant package</a> for all the info regarding the event if you plan on waiting to see if any spots become available.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please <a href="mailto:makeuoft@gmail.com">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>Best,<br>
The MakeUofT Team</p>
