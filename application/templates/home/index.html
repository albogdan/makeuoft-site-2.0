                        <h4>What is a <span style="color:#F7B095">makeathon</span>?</h4>
                        <p>A makeathon is like a hackathon but more hands-on. It involves the integration of hardware and software to build a working device that could be used in any application from gaming to solving a real life problem! As such, we require all participants to build some sort of physical device that is at the very least electrically powered or computer programmed.</p>

                        <h4>What if I have <span style="color:#9C9AC4">no experience</span>? Can I still come?</h4>
                        <p>Yes! MakeUofT is for everyone, from beginners to veterans. There will be a series of workshops throughout the event where you will have the opportunity to learn technical skills from industry mentors. Also, if you ever get stuck on your project just ask one of the mentors!</p>

                        <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
                        <p>Everything is free of charge! There is no application fee and weâ€™ll be providing all the components, equipment, and food youâ€™ll need.</p>

                        <!--h4>What types of hardware and equipment will there be?</h4>
                        <p>We have a variety of hardware, ranging from Arduinos to Qualcomm Dragonboards! We also have a wide assortment of peripheral boards, sensors, and other hardware components. 3D printers and basic electronics equipment will also be provided. If thereâ€™s something in particular that youâ€™d like to see at MakeUofT, feel free to send us an email and weâ€™ll see what we can do!</p>

                        <h4>How does judging work?</h4>
                        <p>Judging will be done by a panel of industry representatives and will be based on a few criteria, such as technical complexity, originality, and presentation. Prizes will be awarded to teams in several categories!</p>

                        <h4>Can I keep what I make?</h4>
                        <p>Any components you brought yourself, of course! However, since the majority of the provided hardware is not our own property, those components will have to be returned.</p>


                        <h4>Are you providing travel reimbursements?</h4>
                        <p>Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide travel reimbursements at MakeUofT 2019 - but look out for MakeUofT 2020 to see if this changes in the future!</p>

                        <h4>What time is the Makeathon?</h4>
                        <p>Check-in opens at 9:00 am on Saturday, February 16, and the event ends at 5:00 pm on Sunday, February 17. We will release a full schedule closer to the event!</p>

                        <!--h4>Who can apply? When is the deadline to apply?</h4>
                        <p>Weâ€™re welcoming any students of age 18 or over! Applications open on December 28th and close at 11:59 PM EST on January 31st. Acceptances will be internally decided on a rolling basis, so apply early to maximize your chances of getting accepted!</p>

                        <h4>Can I apply with a team?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, you can! Simply indicate that youâ€™re applying as a team on the application and give your teammates your unique team ID. Please keep in mind that teams are a maximum of 4 people. During the application screening process, we will be considering teams as a whole. However, there may be exceptional circumstances where we decide to only accept certain members of the team, due to their outstanding application.</p>

                        <h4>I donâ€™t have a team or idea - what should I do?</h4>
                        <p>No worries! We can help you find a team on the day of the event. Also, there will be mentors present at the event to help you generate ideas.</p>

                        <h4>Is everyone going to be accepted?</h4>
                        <p>Unfortunately, no, because there is only a limited amount of hardware compared to the number of applicants. You will be selected based on your experience and enthusiasm.</p>

                        <h4>When will I hear back from you? What do I do once I have been accepted?</h4>
                        <p>The latest you will get a response is February 10th. If you have been accepted at any point, then you must buy a free ticket through the Eventbrite link we give you through an acceptance email. This must be done by the deadline stated in your acceptance email or you will automatically lose your spot. Once you have bought a free Eventbrite ticket, you may wait for us to send you participation details in the days right before the Makeathon. After that, get ready for MakeUofT 2019!</p>
