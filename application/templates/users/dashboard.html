        <h1>Thanks for Applying!</h1>
        <p>Thanks for submitting an application! We have received it, and will be processing them in the order they are received. Keep an eye on your email, our <a href="https://ieee.utoronto.ca/makeuoft">website</a>, and our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/makeuoft/">Facebook page</a> for more details as they come out!</p>
        <p>Within the coming weeks, you'll be able to form teams with fellow applicants on this page. Teams are not required in advance - you're welcome to pair up with other hackers on the first day of the event! However, we will be processing applications by team, so we recommend you get a group of friends (or partners-in-crime) to apply with you. We'll notify you via email when team creation is open.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please <a href="mailto:makeuoft@gmail.com">contact us</a>.</p>
